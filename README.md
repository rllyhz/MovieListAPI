# Hello My Georgeous Friends in The Internet ‚óï ‚Äø ‚óï

[Today](# "15 December 2019"), I have created something awesome and want to share with y'all‚ù§. That's my second project after **`Text Editor App`**. It is a **`Movie List WebApp`**. This WebApp was built using [`HTML`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HyperText Markup Language"), [`CSS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets"), and then [`Javascript`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "Javascript") language for the entire logic of the app. You can run this app in any of the latest Web Browser, such as Chrome (recommended), Firefox, Opera, etc.

**`Movie List WebApp`** use [**`Omdb API`**](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to get all of the data of the movies. So the data will be obtained from the API and be extracted to the website using [AJAX Technology](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)>). so you no longer need to think about it and just be happy with this simple app :D.

I hope you enjoyed this app and please feel free to download it and to share with your another gorgeous friends around the world! :)

**Love yall** ~emotLove\* ‚ù§
